# atari-reinforcement-learning
clean and tunable implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to play atari games

### to do
* if current training framework works, add plot/save (pickle) function to save and watch agent play games
* just clean up code in general, deal with numpy deprecations and whatnot
* try to fix heavy cpu load and smoother/faster training process
